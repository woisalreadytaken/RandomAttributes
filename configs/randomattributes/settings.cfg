// This config sets recommended settings for map prefixes, or gamemodes for Red Sun specifically (Sourcemod doesnt seem to like custom gamemode names very well, so it's unsupported for everyone as of now)
//
// The following settings you can modify with this config are:
//	- amount: amount of attributes to be given per weapon (convar sm_ra_amount)
//	- active_only: value 1 forces the 'provide on active' attribute to be given to weapons, making passive attributes these weapons have to be locked as active ones instead (convar sm_ra_activeonly)
//	- blacklist: removes attributes from the random pool for the current map or gamemode, defined by attribute indexes, separated by spaces
//	- only_allow_team: sets which team is able to receive random attributes, accepts "red" and "blu", any other value is disregarded (convar sm_ra_onlyallowteam)
//	- reroll_on_death (convar sm_ra_rerolldeath): 
//		- 0: doesn't reroll attributes when a player dies (only when a round starts)
//		- 1: reroll attributes when a player dies, as long as it's not from a suicide
//		- 2: reroll attributes when a player dies, with no exceptions
//	- reroll_on_slot_change: value 1 rerolls attributes before applying to the new weapon a player has received. Optional for support to custom gamemodes that give weapons to players mid-round (convar sm_ra_rerollslot)
//
// Settings in "Default" are the, well, default settings and should always be there
// Settings in "Map" and "RedSunGamemode" will overwrite default values if name matches
//	"RedSunGamemode" takes priority over "Map" (but will be skipped if not on Red Sun)
//	"RedSunGamemode" only accepts exact names, while "Map" only accepts map prefixes
//	If a setting isn't in the matching map/gamemode block, it'll continue using the default value instead
//	If a value for a setting is "-1", it'll keep using what the convar is already set to
//
// The config can be refreshed mid-game with sm_ra_refreshsettings
